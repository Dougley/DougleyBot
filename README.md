A chat bot for discord app based off <a href="https://github.com/chalda/DiscordBot/">Chalda's DiscordBot</a>, which is based off <a href="https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/">discord.js</a>.

# If you're not very technical
**For the sake of decentralisation, consider using your own copy of DougleyBot.**

If you plan on just using DougleyBot as a chatbot, and don't plan on using the files, you can make DougleyBot join your server via DougleyBot's Test server (https://discord.gg/0cFoiR5QVh57Spqg). Use `!join-server DougleyBot <instant-invite>` to make DougleyBot join your server.
**Note** that admin restricted commands, like `!pullanddeploy`, `!online` and `!idle`, don't work on this instance.

## Todo

- [x] Make it that bot runs without some of the code from the original DiscordBot.
- [x] Clean up the code a bit.
    - [ ] Clean up the code some more.
- [ ] Make it so that !help takes arguments, so it can explain functions independently.
- [x] Add permissions to certain commands. (Like !pullanddeploy, !online, !idle)
    - [ ] Make permissions more advanced.
- [x] Add more memes and abbreviations for the !meme and !game commands.
    - [ ] Add even more memes and abbreviations.
    - [ ] Create a function that will pull the popular memes from Imgflip, and integrate them automatically.
- [ ] Integrate !memehelp into !help.
- [ ] Integrate a WolframAlpha command. The original DiscordBot had one, but that didn't work.
- [ ] Make it so that log files are written when !log is used, instead of printing them to the console.
- [x] Make it so that !help outputs into a DM, instead of printing it into the channel.
- [ ] Intergrate Cleverbot support, but restrict it to a certain channel.
- [ ] Integrate a function to make DougleyBot stream music to a certain voice channel. (discord.js is being rewritten to support voice.)
- [ ] Create a function to make DougleyBot create text/voice channels, but restrict it to a certain permission.
